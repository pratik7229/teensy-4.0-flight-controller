# Teensy 4.0 Flight Controller
The Teensy 4.0 flight controller is a cutting-edge flight control system built upon the Teensy 4.0 microcontroller, boasting a formidable 600 MHz processing speed. Equipped with a suite of advanced sensors including the MPU6050, MS5611, HMC5883L, GPS, and more, this flight controller is designed with the ambitious goal of achieving full autonomy.
In contrast to traditional PID control systems, this project is set to utilize Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance the drone's stability and performance. While the project is currently a work in progress, the integration of MPC control represents a significant step toward achieving a fully autonomous drone system. Stay tuned for further developments as the project advances towards completion.
